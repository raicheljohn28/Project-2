# kudozo

An application built to provide foodie reviews and ratings for restaurants.

User login page to allow user to register and post reviews.

Posted reviews are updated in the database and displayed on the frontend.

Clicking on the ‘Add Review’ button updates the ‘UserName’ , ‘Restaurant’, ‘Review’ and ‘Ratings’.

Our motivation was based on User preferences at providing their feedback on a particular restaurant or eatery.

A one stop show for all restaurant reviews helps users to select the best restaurant in town.

Future Enhancements:
Options for an ‘Organic Only’ and ‘Probiotic Only’ search.

 ‘Table Booking’ options apart from the Review and Ratings.
 
 A ‘Know How’ section to understand the recipe history and preparation.
 
 ‘Mouse over’ option for the synopsis of the dish on the A La Carte.
